### Logic
Player can move to **right (`R`) or down (`D`)** in a 48 * 48 matrix.
Each cell has a random value between -40 and 10.
The player starts from the top-left cell (0, 0) and should try its way to the bottom-right cell (47, 47).
The player has a `checker` variable which starts from 333.
The player should keep the `checker` variable **positive** during the game.
If the player reaches the <u>bottom-right cell with `checker` equal to 1</u>, the flag will be printed.

## Solution
1. Dump the matrix after the random shuffle.
    > `parse.py`
    - dump the memory for the matrix. (after the shuffle, `0x4abbf0`)
    - parse the dumped memory to get the matrix.
2. Assume the checker becomes 1 at the end of the game is its maximum value.
    - Problem becomes a **Maximum Sum Path in Matrix** problem.
    - Dynamic Programming to find the maximum sum path.
        > `solve.py`
        - Maximum Sum for the bottom-right cell **is 1**.
        - Therefore, the maximum sum path is the path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell to get the flag.
